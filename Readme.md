Initialize a new Rust project:

- In the terminal, run the following command to initialize a new Rust project with a binary crate (an executable program):
    cargo new project_name

Basic Project Commands:

- Build your project:
cargo build
This command compiles your Rust code and generates an executable in the target/debug directory.

- Run your project:
cargo run
This command builds your project (if there are any changes) and then runs the generated executable.

- Check your code for errors without producing an executable:
cargo check
This is a faster way to check for errors compared to cargo build.

- Run tests:
cargo test
This command runs any tests you've written in your Rust code.
